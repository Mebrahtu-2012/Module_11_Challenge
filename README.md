# Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project! This repository contains code and resources for scraping and analyzing Mars-related data. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Scraping Mars News Articles**: Extracting titles and preview text from Mars news articles using web scraping techniques.
2. **Scraping and Analyzing Mars Weather Data**: Scraping temperature and atmospheric pressure data from a webpage, analyzing it, and visualizing insights.

## Getting Started
To run the code and replicate the results:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory for each part of the project (`part_1_mars_news.ipynb` and `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks and follow the instructions provided within.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Beautiful Soup
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Deliverables
1. **Part 1**: Scraped titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
2. **Part 2**: Scraped and analyzed Mars weather data, including visualizations.

## Insights
- Determined the number of months on Mars and the Martian days' worth of data available.
- Identified the coldest and warmest months on Mars based on temperature data.
- Analyzed atmospheric pressure trends on Mars throughout the Martian months.
- Estimated the number of terrestrial days in a Martian year through data visualization.

## Collaboration and References
This project was completed with a study group, leveraging class activities as a reference. Additionally, the following resources were instrumental:
- Stack Overflow: for troubleshooting and guidance on Beautiful Soup.
- Code Beautify Blog: for understanding JSON conversion in Python.
- OpenAI's ChatGPT: for debugging assistance.

## Conclusion
This project showcases proficiency in web scraping, data extraction, analysis, and visualization techniques using Python. The insights gained provide valuable information about Mars weather patterns and news updates.
